Amaze-ing
=========

This is a terrible maze game. Actually. It has maybe four levels, although
two of them can't even be considered mazes. Two of the levels are decent, but
it doesn't change the fact that I had to painfully construct them manually because
I slapped this project together without thought that maybe I'd want an easier way
to do that.

Anyway, the idea is that you drag your finger through the maze, starting at green and
going to the red spots. Touch walls or lift off your finger and you have to start the
level over again.

BTW, fun glitch in the game: move fast enough and you can jump walls. Yeah. It's awesome.
You're welcome.
